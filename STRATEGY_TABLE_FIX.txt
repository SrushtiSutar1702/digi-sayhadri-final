The StrategyDashboard.js file has leftover code from lines 2241-2595 that needs to be deleted.

Delete everything between:
- Line 2241: Starting with `<td style={{ textAlign: 'center'...`
- Line 2595: Ending just before `{/* Assign Task Form Modal */}`

This leftover code is from the old expanded section that was removed.

After deletion, the structure should be:
```
        </div>  // Line 2240

        {/* Assign Task Form Modal */}  // Line 2241 (after deletion)
        {showAssignForm && (
```

The main table now shows all clients with their 4 stages displayed inline in the STAGES column.
